# What I learnt
square brackets are for selecting one part of a string
: is the delimiter of the slice syntax to 'slice out' sub-parts in sequences [start:end]
slice: slice statement [::-1] means start at the end of the string and end at position 0, move with the step -1, negative one, which means one step backwards.
